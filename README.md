# Starship-Vehicle-Expansion
A mod that adds additional vehicles to KSP, as an addon to SEP.

# Dependencies
Starship Expansion Project latest version (including beta) with all of its dependencies

## VERY recommended:
Resurfaced, Shabby for shiny parts and proper textures
HullcamVDS for camera views

# How to use
Make sure the vehicle has 6 engines (3x Raptor 1 SL and 3x Raptor 1 Vac) to descend stably. Also make sure the header tank is full while the main tanks are empty.
